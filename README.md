Welcome to My Web Development Practice Repository!

This repository serves as a space for me to store and showcase my web development practice projects. I'm currently in the learning and development phase, and I'm excited to share my progress here.

Current Projects:

MERN Chat App Master: A fully functional chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project demonstrates my understanding of database integration, real-time communication, and front-end development with React.
Text-to-Speech Converter: A webpage that converts text into spoken audio output. This project explores user interaction, text manipulation, and potentially the Web Speech API for audio generation.
Future Projects :
 -> E-commerce website
 -> Online AI Sign Language Decoders
